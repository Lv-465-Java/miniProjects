# miniProjects

My-Wallet project is a personal budget web-based application whose main goal is to simplify tracking of current incomes, outcomes and plan your future spendings. 

In a system, each user has his personal page, where he is able to edit some personal data, change a password and create categories for detailed money tracking. **Categories** are used while recording **incomes** or **outcomes** and are useful for various sorting options in order to make the analysis of the budget easier. 

The **planned outcome dashboard** is additional functionality for people who are interested in planning their future spendings. It is totally flexible and is closely related to current records since user is able to migrate his future planned spendings to current outcomes. Additionally, the user is able to filter all his records by date or type using implemented filter functionality on a **record dashboard page**.
